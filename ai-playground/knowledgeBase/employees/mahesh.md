# Mahesh — AI Engineer

Hello, I’m **Mahesh**, part of FlightAI’s AI research team.  
I design and train the models that power our intelligent chat assistant and flight prediction systems.

My focus areas include language modeling, retrieval-augmented generation, and anomaly detection.  
I also collaborate on fairness and bias evaluation in AI models — because trust is the foundation of great AI.
