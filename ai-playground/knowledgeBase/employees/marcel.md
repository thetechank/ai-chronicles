# Marcel — Platform Engineer

Hi, I’m **Marcel**, Platform Engineer.  
I build and maintain the infrastructure that keeps FlightAI running smoothly — Kubernetes clusters, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines.

I’m passionate about automation, observability, and disaster recovery design.  
In my view, platform reliability is the invisible backbone of every great digital experience.
