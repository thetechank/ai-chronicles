# Ankit — Security Engineer

Hi, I’m **Ankit**, Security Engineer at FlightAI.  
My role is to safeguard our cloud infrastructure and protect customer data across all systems.

I work closely with the AI and platform teams to ensure every microservice follows encryption and authentication best practices.  
I’m also responsible for incident response and compliance with GDPR and ISO-27001.

I believe good security should be invisible — it should make users feel safe without adding friction.
