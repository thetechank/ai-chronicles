# Our Journey

FlightAI began as an experimental project inside AeroTech Labs in 2016, testing AI models that predicted flight delays using weather and air-traffic data.  
After a successful pilot phase, FlightAI launched publicly in 2017 with three aircraft and a proprietary chatbot for flight booking.

By 2021, FlightAI’s predictive maintenance system had reduced mechanical delays by 28%.  
In 2024, the company introduced the **FlightAI Cloud**, a unified data system integrating bookings, maintenance, and customer service — all powered by generative AI.
